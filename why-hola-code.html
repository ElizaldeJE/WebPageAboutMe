    <h1>Why HolaCode?</h1>
    <p>I found out about HolaCode one day that I was doing overtime (extra hours) during
    primetime when I went out to take a break and get some food. I was just getting outside
    when I stumbled upon a friend that was coming back from his lunch and told that a dude
    from here was just there giving out these little flyers and explaining a little bit about
    the program. He told me what he understood and gave me one of the flyers, I thought about it
    for a moment then that same day I called the number that was on the paper which turned out to be
    Leni, we talked for a bit and she explained with more details what it was all about. I did not
    know what to expect from the informative session the following day, once I got there it all seemed
    like a very small program. Now when the presentation started and the HolaTeam started giving all the
    details about the whole program I was very excited. I left the session sure that I was going to join
    and do my best to make sure that I follow with the program and get the most out of it since this
    is a once in a life time opportunity.</p>
    <p>The reason why I decided to take this challenge upon on is because this is an upgrade to my
    life, not only intellectually but also professionally wise. Just a few days before I was looking into
    the university IPN to do my carrer there for mechatronics. But with this there's no doubt I will
    succeed. I am extremely grateful to everyone who helped pull this proyect together and make it
    happen.</p>

    <h1>Work History</h1>
    <p>Fighting</p>
    <p>I got into making money from fighting profesionally wise, after high school I tried to get
    into med school but it did not happen so I started working out to invest my time in something.
    So I joined a gym near my house, since I had done wrestling preveiously in high school for a
    couple of years I decided to take on MMA which was taught in the same gym. Turns out I was pretty
    good at it, then one day the box professor asked me if I wished to get in the ring for a couple
    of rounds to get a hang of it, from that moment on everything changed. I joined boxing, BJJ,
    Muay Thai (which I ended up chosing this one as my main style) and Capoeira. It became like a
    job since I was in there training everyday from Monday to Saturday at least 9 hours. Once I had
    the skills necessary I requested my first fight, I was just doing it for the love of the sport
    and adrenaline. After a couple of fights I got sponsored by BoneBreakers, signed a contract with
    them and for everyfight I would get paid. Since I love this so much I also started giving classes
    to younger kids. I do still fight every once in a while but not in the same level as I used to,
    I do plan on going back to the ring but first I need to get my life in order so then I can at
    least do this as a hobbie, get a fight in there every other month at least.</p>

    <p>Telvista</p>
    <p>August 2017 - April, 2017</p>
    <p>I found this place after breaking a few fingers on my right foot, I had to make money since
    at the time I was not studying nor was I making money from the fights anymore. It was my first
    oficial job, I did learn a lot in while such as keeping up in a formal schedule, orginized with
    my times, orginizing my bills and being responsable about it. Even though I did learn a lot there
    I am so glad to have gotten out of there, the people within the campaign I was in were too
    much into gossip and talking behind each others back, it was without doubt a very poisonous
    enviroment and everyone would try to pull you down.</p>

    <p>Compucom</p>
    <p>May 2018 - December 2018</p>
    <p>I found this place when the day I went to pick up my settlement at Telvista, an ex-coworker
    from there that was also there for the same reason told me about it and that he was also going to
    go work there. Within the next few days I researched about it and went there to talk to HR what were
    the requirements. Within the next couple of days I was hired and it was such a pleasant change from
    the previous job. Everything was better, the facilities, the people who you interacted with day to day,
    the enviroment and without doubt the pay. Plus it was IT, so much better than what I used to do at the
    previous place.</p>
